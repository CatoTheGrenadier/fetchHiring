Hi! My name is Yi Ling and i'm currently an MSCS student at Syracuse University. I'm very passionate about swift programming, and i have serveral projects related. 

One of them is a farkle game i created before using swift, by the name of "Henry's Joy".(https://github.com/CatoTheGrenadier/Henry-s-Joy-Bohemian-style-Farkle-game) 

And i also have another project called MovieListApp, which downloads and decodes data from TMDB site and creates appropriate UI to display them, both generally and in details.(https://github.com/CatoTheGrenadier/MovieListApp) This includes a lot json downloading, encoding and decoding, very similar to this small application. 

Please feel free to check them out. Also, to view some screenshots of my work, please feel welcome to visited my LinkedIn page https://www.linkedin.com/in/yi-ling-flavius/. Thanks again for reading!
